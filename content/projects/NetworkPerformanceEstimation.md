Machine learning project focused on **predicting RSA metrics** (Routing and Spectrum Assignment) in **Elastic Optical Networks (EONs)**. Uses **regression models** (Linear Regression, Random Forest) to estimate performance metrics (e.g., utilization, transceiver count) based on network traffic and topology. Enables **near-real-time network optimization** by estimating results **significantly faster than full simulations**.
