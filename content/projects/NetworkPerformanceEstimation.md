Project focused on **predicting RSA (Routing and Spectrum Assignment) performance metrics** in **Elastic Optical Networks (EONs)**.

The approach uses **machine learning regression models** (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks) to estimate metrics (e.g., total occupied slots, transceiver count) based on traffic matrices and topology. This method aims to provide near-real-time network design and optimization, achieving results **significantly faster than traditional full simulations**. The implementation utilizes **Python** with **Scikit-learn** and **Pandas** for data processing.
