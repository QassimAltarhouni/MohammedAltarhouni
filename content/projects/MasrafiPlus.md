Mobile banking application for Jumhouria Bank, providing advanced account management, transfers, and a range of financial services. Built with a focus on high security and performance for a large user base.

My role involved contributing to secure API integration, developing core features (transfers/payments), and optimizing the multi-platform deployment pipeline.
