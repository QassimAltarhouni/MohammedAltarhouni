Infrastructure codebase for shared mobile banking components, including common
services, models, and utilities used across multiple banking apps (e.g. Mobimal,
Wahda Mobile, Sahara Mobile).

This project is **private and cannot be publicly shared**, as it contains
company-owned banking architecture, internal API structures, and sensitive
infrastructure logic used in production systems.
