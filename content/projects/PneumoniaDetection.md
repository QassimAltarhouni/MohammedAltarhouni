A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project focused on analyzing chest X-ray images for the automated detection of Pneumonia, aiding in rapid diagnosis.

**Dataset:** Trained using the public Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) Kaggle dataset.
**Metrics:** Evaluated primarily on **ROC-AUC** and **Sensitivity (Recall)** to minimize false negative diagnoses.
