A Python-based toolkit for **analyzing 5G network coverage** and optimizing tower deployments using **genetic algorithms**.
It integrates population raster data with real tower coordinates (OpenCellID) to model signal reach, identify underserved areas, and propose new tower locations that minimize coverage gaps.

Generated **interactive Folium maps** and **density visualizations** to guide network expansion and balance load across towers.

I designed and implemented the core optimization logic, data preprocessing pipeline, and visualization dashboards for performance evaluation.
