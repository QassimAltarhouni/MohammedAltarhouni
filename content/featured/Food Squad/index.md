A modern **restaurant management and food ordering platform** built with Angular and Spring Boot.
It includes a polished public website for customers and a full-featured **Admin Dashboard** for managing menu items, orders, users, and tables.

Supports category filtering, cart flow, user profiles with avatar uploads, dark/light mode, and color theme switching.
Integrated with Stripe for payments, Swagger for API documentation, and responsive UI using Tailwind CSS.

I designed and developed the complete frontend (Angular + NgRx) and contributed to backend integration, CRUD workflows, and admin analytics dashboards.
